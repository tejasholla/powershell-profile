A stylish and functional PowerShell profile that looks and feels almost as good as a Linux terminal.

## ⚡ One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

> [!WARNING]  
> Powershell Run As Administrator.

```powershell
irm "https://github.com/tejasholla/powershell-profile/raw/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

## 🛠️ Fix the Missing Font

After running the script, you'll find a downloaded `cove.zip` file in the folder you executed the script from. Follow these steps to install the required nerd fonts:

1. Extract the `cove.zip` file.
2. Locate and install the nerd fonts.

Now, enjoy your enhanced and stylish PowerShell experience! 🚀
