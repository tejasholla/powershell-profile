## üõ†Ô∏è Fix the Missing Font

After running the script, you'll find a downloaded `cove.zip` file in the folder you executed the script from. Follow these steps to install the required nerd fonts:

1. Extract the `cove.zip` file.
2. Locate and install the nerd fonts.

## Customize this profile

**Do not make any changes to the `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file**, since it's hashed and automatically overwritten by any commits to this repository.
After the profile is installed and active, run the `Edit-Profile` function to create a separate profile file for your current user.
